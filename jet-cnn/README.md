## Running jet-cnn code

The main files within this directory accomplish three main points: training the CNN on jet images, making predictions on type of jets within new data, and performing a simple hypothesis test to ascertain the significance level at which data can be said to be containing top jets. 

To train the CNN run 
```
python KerasCNN.py
```
This takes in data of QCD and top jet images, stored within `Data/`, and outputs a trained CNN h5 model file within a new directory called `model_cnn`.

To make predictions over new data run
