-----------------

The paper demonstrates how to use the outputs of supervised classifiers or unsupervised anomaly detection methods can be used in Log-Likelihood Ratio hypothesis tests and in obtaining discovery significances. Events are generated through [`MadGraph`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0522) along with [`Pythia`](https://arxiv.org/abs/0710.3820) and [`Delphes`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6346) for showering and detector effects.
